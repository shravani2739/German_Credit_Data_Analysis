# German_Credit_Data_Analysis


This repository contains code and resources for comparing various machine learning models on the German Credit Dataset. The German Credit Dataset is a widely used dataset for binary classification tasks, where the objective is to predict whether a person is a good or bad credit risk based on various features.

## Overview

In this project, we explore the performance of different machine learning algorithms on the German Credit Dataset. We aim to compare the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of each model to determine which one performs best for this particular task.

## Dataset

The German Credit Dataset consists of 1000 instances with 10 features, including both numerical and categorical variables. The target variable indicates whether the individual is a good credit risk (label '1') or a bad credit risk (label '0').

## Models Explored

The following machine learning models are explored in this project:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes
- Custom Logistics Regression Model

## Evaluation Metrics

We evaluate the performance of each model using the following metrics:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

## Files in the Repository

- `data/`: Contains the German Credit Dataset in CSV format.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
  

## Getting Started

To run the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and run the Jupyter notebooks sequentially for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Results

The results of the model comparison are summarized.Each model's performance metrics are recorded in jupyter notebook files for easy comparison.
